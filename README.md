5 . Features/Highlights

 (i) Business Problem:
    The primary business problem this dashboard aims to address is employee attrition. High employee turnover can be costly for an organization due to expenses related to recruitment, onboarding, training, and lost productivity. Understanding the factors contributing to attrition is crucial for developing effective retention strategies. This dashboard likely seeks to identify patterns and trends in employee departures to help HR and management understand why employees are leaving and which groups are most affected.

(ii) Goal of the Dashboard:
    The main goals of this HR Analytics Dashboard are to:
    Visualize the overall attrition rate and count to provide a clear snapshot of the current attrition situation.
    Identify key drivers of attrition by analyzing attrition across various employee demographics and characteristics such as education field, age, salary slab, years at the company, and job role.
    Enable data-driven decision-making by equipping HR and management with actionable insights to develop targeted retention strategies and reduce employee turnover.
    Monitor the impact of retention initiatives, potentially tracking attrition trends over time to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies.
