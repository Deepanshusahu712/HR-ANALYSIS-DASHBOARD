Q9. Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in attrition based on Education Field, Age, Salary Slab, Years at Company, or Job Role?


1. Attrition by Education Field (The "Pie Chart")

What it shows: This pie chart tells us which education backgrounds have more people leaving the company.
Simple Description: Most people who leave the company come from Life Sciences (a big slice) and Medical backgrounds (another big slice). Fewer people are leaving who have a Technical Degree or are in Marketing.
Pattern: People with science or medical degrees seem to leave more often.
2. Attrition by Age (The "Blue Bar Chart")

What it shows: This bar chart tells us which age groups have the most people leaving.
Simple Description: The tallest blue bar is for people between 26 and 35 years old. Many more people leave in this age group than any other. As people get older (36-45, 46-55, 55+), fewer and fewer people leave.
Pattern: Younger adults (mid-20s to mid-30s) are much more likely to leave the company.
3. Attrition by Salary Slab (The "Long Blue Bar Chart")

What it shows: This bar chart tells us which salary levels have the most people leaving.
Simple Description: The longest blue bar is for people earning "Upto 5k" (under $5,000). This means a huge number of people with lower salaries are leaving. As salaries go up ("5k-10k", "10k-15k", "15k+"), very few people leave.
Pattern: People who earn less money are much more likely to leave the company. Money seems to be a big reason for people to quit.
4. Attrition by Year At Company (The "Wavy Line Graph")

What it shows: This line graph tells us how many people leave based on how many years they've been with the company.
Simple Description: There's a very big spike, meaning a lot of people leave, in their first couple of years at the company. After that, fewer people leave. There's a smaller bump around 5-7 years, but mostly, if you stay past a couple of years, you're more likely to stay longer.
Pattern: Many employees leave very early in their time with the company.
5. Attrition by Job Role (The "Mixed Color Bar Chart" on the right)

What it shows: This bar chart tells us which job roles have the most people leaving.
Simple Description: The job roles with the most people leaving are "Laboratory-", "Sales Executive-", and "Research Scientist-". Fewer people leave if they are in "Manufacture-" roles.
Pattern: Some specific jobs, like those in labs, sales, and research, have more people quitting than others.
